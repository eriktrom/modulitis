## Modulitis

Adds the following features usable in your models, controllers and views:

- videoable
- imageable
- listable
- audioable

The code may be worth copying, but I wouldn't recommend just using it as is. It's from circa 2011 and while several of my client's apps use it, I had no clue what I was doing as a developer, so the features are a bit brittle and require copying and pasting in some situations. 

Nonetheless, it was my first taste of DRY, which was exciting.


This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
